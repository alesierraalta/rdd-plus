# Test plan — <app / module>

Created: <date> · Last updated: <date> · Plan path: `docs/testing/test-plan.md` · Sandbox: <worktree / container / scratchpad> · Findings precision: <confirmed+fixed> / <rows with a verdict>
Baseline: `<git rev>` · untracked files: <count> · fingerprint: `<assets/fingerprint.sh output>` (a change is anything that differs from this fingerprint, not raw `git status`)

## Inventory

| Surface | Entry points | Owner module | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|

## Ranked targets

Rows are never removed by budget; budget changes order and status only. Rows contributed by a
sibling in the layer sweep name that sibling in "Sibling skill".

| Target | Blast radius | Churn / past fixes | Consequence class | Existing evidence | Altitude | Target rung | Sibling skill | Verdict | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

Verdicts: probe · pin · none. Statuses: pending · in progress · done · blocked · n/a.
A `none` verdict is created with status `n/a`; the execution ratio excludes `n/a` rows.

## Real-run recipes

How each critical journey is driven for real (`real-run-validation`), so EXECUTE never rediscovers it.

| Journey | Start command | Data setup | Sample requests | Expected observable |
|---|---|---|---|---|

## Layer matrix

| Layer | Skill | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Security | `appsec-adversarial-auditor` | auth boundaries, untrusted input, secrets | pending |
| Runtime and faults | `runtime-reliability-testing` | load, latency, fault injection, smoke | pending |
| Persistence and migrations | `database-persistence-testing` | migration naming/order/idempotency, isolation, N+1 | pending |
| Architecture conformance | `clean-architecture-audit` | layer purity, targeted mutation | pending |
| Critical e2e journeys | `real-run-validation` | <journey 1>, <journey 2>, <journey 3> | pending |
| Sandbox | `docker-test-containers` | ephemeral DB/cache, environment proof | pending |

Statuses: pending · in progress · done · blocked · n/a. `plan gaps` counts a row as swept when its
status cell reads `done`, `fixed` or `closed`, and drops `n/a`, `na`, `none` and `skipped` from the
denominator entirely; the `Skill` cell only labels the rows still owed. In a plan that declares
`Light:`, every `n/a` row also states its reason in the `Scope` cell.

## Findings

A rejected or wontfix finding is a known non-issue: it is never re-proposed unless the fingerprint
of its cited files changed; when a run skips it, it cites the row. Severity is the consequence class
(`references/prioritization.md`); always state whether data is safe. A `confirmed` or `fixed`
finding names the promoted test that asserts the promised behaviour, so it is red on the current
code and green once fixed (rule 13); a test written the other way round is a characterization
test and says so in its name. A finding that never got a test stays `open`, reason `not pinned`.

| Id | Finding (path:line, one line) | Severity (consequence class) | Data safe? | Evidence id | Pinning test (suite path :: test name) | Status | Verdict by / date | Reason | Cited-files fingerprint at verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

Statuses: open · confirmed · fixed · rejected · wontfix.

## Evidence ledger

One row per `observado` conclusion (`references/evidence.md`). `razonado` items go under
"Hypotheses" below, never here.

| Id | Claim | Executed | Admit | Inputs and parameters | Observed | Digest | Normalize | Mode | Mutation or negative control → result | Reproduction | Label (`observado` / `razonado`, literal) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

`Admit` holds ONE bare shell command, with no backticks and no placeholders, because `Executed` is
prose a human reads and `Admit` is the command the binary runs. `Digest` holds the `sha256:` digest of the
canonical output, written by `rdd-plus plan admit --execute --record <id>` rather than by hand.

A pin only means something over output that holds still, so `--execute` runs each admitted command twice:
the second run is the probe, and a row whose two observations disagree is refused as unstable instead of
pinned. `Normalize` is the escape hatch for the part of an output that legitimately moves, such as an
elapsed time: it holds a Go regular expression whose every match becomes `X` before hashing. Leave it empty
the first time and fill it only when the probe names what moves, keeping it as narrow as that part — a
pattern broad enough to swallow the output turns the pin into decoration. `plan check` requires none of
these columns; `plan admit` refuses a row whose `Admit` is absent, whose `Digest` is unpinned, or whose
output does not hold still.

`Mode` says where the observation was taken, and a pin is only comparable inside the mode it was taken in,
because the same command digests differently in a container than on this machine. An empty cell means `host`,
which is where every pin taken before the column existed was taken. `--sandbox` runs each command in a
container with the tree mounted read-only and no network, and a row that tries to write is refused instead
of admitted. `--record` writes both cells, so recording is how a row's mode gets set; a row pinned in one mode
and checked in the other is refused as a mode mismatch, rather than as a digest mismatch that would say
nothing about why the digests disagree.

### Hypotheses (razonado)

| Hypothesis | Probe that would settle it |
|---|---|

## Calibration history

One row per calibration run (`references/calibration.md`); never overwritten.

| Date | Skill version | K | Found | Recall | Misses (file:line operator, why) | False positives |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

## Blocked by testability

| Target | Rung | Why | Minimal change that opens it |
|---|---|---|---|

## Remaining, in order
