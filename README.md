# rdd-plus

A deterministic companion for the testing discipline in Claude Code. It complements gentle-ai; it
does not replace it. gentle-ai owns the review lifecycle (frozen candidate, refuter, receipts).
rdd-plus owns what happens before that: a testing flow the model runs and a set of Go binaries
that keep it honest.

The split is deliberate. The model does the creative work: enumerating the classes of a contract,
imagining the inputs nobody expects, writing the probe. The binaries do the deterministic work:
installing the skills, wiring the hook that keeps them invoked, and reporting what the
environment can do so a skill degrades explicitly instead of failing on a tool it assumed.

## Install

```sh
go install github.com/alesierraalta/rdd-plus/cmd/rdd-plus@latest
rdd-plus sync      # installs the skills into ~/.claude/skills and wires the Stop hook
rdd-plus doctor    # verifies the install and lists optional capabilities
```

`sync` merges into `~/.claude/settings.json`: every existing hook and setting is preserved, the
gate is added once, and running it again changes nothing. A skill you edited locally is moved to
`~/.claude/skills/.rdd-plus-backup/<name>-<timestamp>/` before it is replaced. An unparseable
`settings.json` aborts the run before anything is written. Use `--config-dir` to target another
directory and `--dry-run` to see the plan.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `rdd-plus gate` | The Stop hook. Reads the hook payload on stdin, decides, logs one line, and emits Stop feedback when a session changed production source without loading the adversarial testing discipline. Always exits 0. |
| `rdd-plus sync` | Installs the embedded skills and wires the gate. Idempotent. |
| `rdd-plus doctor` | Reports installed skills (and whether they drift from the embedded version), whether the hook is wired, and which optional tools are on PATH with what degrades without each. `--json` for machines. Exit 1 when git, a skill, or the hook is missing. |
| `rdd-plus version` | Prints the version. |

## How the gate decides

At the end of every turn the gate fires only when all of these hold:

- the working directory is inside a git repository with at most 20 000 status entries (a home
  directory has hundreds of thousands; a project never does);
- at least one production source file changed after the session started, where the session start
  is the first `timestamp` in the session transcript and production source means a source
  extension outside test, fixture, vendored, build, and Claude configuration trees;
- neither `test-strategy` nor `exploit-testing` was actually invoked in the session (a name in the
  available-skills listing does not count; a Skill call or a read of its `SKILL.md` does);
- the repository has no `.no-testing-gate` file at its root;
- the turn is not already continuing because of a previous Stop hook.

When it fires, the feedback names the files and asks for `test-strategy` ("haz el testing").
It is a reminder, not an approval gate.

Telemetry: every decision appends one JSON line to `~/.claude/telemetry/testing-gate.jsonl`
(override with `TESTING_GATE_LOG`), so the invocation rate is measurable over time.

## Skills

The embedded skills live under `assets/skills/`. `test-strategy` is the organic entry point
("haz el testing"): it infers the mode from repository state, persists a plan that never
shrinks, sweeps the specialized skills for their own checks, and executes through
`exploit-testing`, whose ladder climbs from contract classes and hostile inputs to real
collaborators, real seams, injected faults, and concurrency. Every finding carries an executed
evidence record; anything not executed is a hypothesis.

## Development

```sh
go test ./...           # unit, integration (real git repositories), and differential tests
go run ./tools/mutants  # 23 literal mutants on the gate; every one must be killed
make build              # bin/rdd-plus
```

Integration tests build the CLI once and drive it with real repositories in temporary
directories; they are skipped under `-short`. The differential test compares the Go gate with the
original Node hook when `node` and `~/.claude/hooks/testing-gate.mjs` are present.

## Pending

- The eval harness (`assets/skills/test-strategy/evals/run_evals.py`, `selftest.py`) and the
  calibration tools (`assets/skills/test-strategy/assets/seed-mutants.py`, `fingerprint.sh`) are
  still Python and shell. They will become subcommands.
- Deterministic admission of evidence (re-executing a ledger row's command and re-applying its
  mutation before a finding is accepted), plan validation, and `status --next-transition` are the
  next binaries.

## Benchmark

`rdd-plus bench` measures whether the testing skill finds defects it was never told about. Each
case under `bench/cases/<id>/` is a fixture project whose own suite is green plus a sealed
`KEY.json` listing the planted defects (file, line, class, keywords, trigger). The key is never
copied into a workspace.

```
rdd-plus bench run --cases 'bench/cases/*' --model sonnet --runs 1 --max-cost-usd 20
rdd-plus bench score --case bench/cases/<id> --workspace <ws>     # re-score after grader changes
rdd-plus bench history                                            # every run, never rewritten
rdd-plus bench rescore bench/results/<run>                        # re-read a finished run with today's rules
rdd-plus bench compare bench/results/<before> bench/results/<after>   # per-case reported and caught, side by side
```

`bench run` scaffolds `<out>/<case>/<run>/ws` (default `bench/results/<timestamp>/`), commits the
fixture, checks its suite is green (otherwise the case is invalid and skipped), spawns
`claude -p "haz el testing"` in it, then scores `docs/testing/test-plan.md`:

Two measures per planted defect, because saying it and catching it are different claims.

**Reported** reads `docs/testing/test-plan.md`: a defect is found when a Findings row cites its
file (suffix match, so `render.js:9` and `fixture/src/render.js` both name `src/render.js`) and
either a line within ±5 of the planted line or one of its keywords. The row must cite an id that
exists in the Evidence ledger; an unlinked row is prose and does not count, and an empty ledger
makes every citation dangling. The file and line may come from the linked ledger rows, the
keyword only from the finding itself. A row matching no planted defect is a **false positive**.

**Caught** ignores the plan and asks whether the tests distinguish broken code from correct code.
Each case ships `fix/all/` (every defect fixed) and, when it has more than one, `fix/keep-<ID>/`
(every defect but that one fixed). The test files the agent added or changed are carried onto each
variant and run per test: a test green on `fix/all` and red on `fix/keep-D` catches D. A test red
on `fix/all` is broken or written to another API, so it is ignored and counted separately; a test
green everywhere catches nothing.

**Pinned** reads the plan's `Pinning test` cell: it counts defects whose finding names a test that
holds them. Naming a test and having one that distinguishes the defect are different claims, so
pinned sits next to caught, never instead of it. Plans written before rule 13 have no such column
and simply claim nothing.

The gap between the columns is the interesting number. A run can report a defect it never
pinned with a test, or catch one it never wrote down.

Per run: `result.json` and the `test-plan.md` it produced, kept even when the workspace is
removed. Per bench: `aggregate.json`, `summary.md`, one line in `bench/history.jsonl` and one row
in `bench/history.md` with the installed `test-strategy` version, so skill versions compare on
identical fixtures. `--dry-run` scaffolds and checks fixtures without spawning or recording;
`--max-cost-usd` stops early with exit code 2; a run with any failed or invalid case exits 3, so a
partial number is never read as a corpus result.
